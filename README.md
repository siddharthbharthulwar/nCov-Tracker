# nCov-Tracker

Mathematical and statistical toolkit for tracking and monitoring the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19. Current functions include exponential and logistic regression for all regions, as well as future forecasting based on minimizing cost functions. 

TODO:
- Actually fix interface
- Implement exponential and simulated mathematical models
- Per country statistics and graphs (probably easiest to do)
